      "`stdout`. Normally, the the input channel for the shell is the keyboard, and the output channel is the screen. The >, >>, < and | characters on the command line tell the shell to get the input (<,|) or send the (>, >>, |) someplace else. \n",

      "<img src='files/img/shell-process-repl.png' alt='a shell process' width=60%>\n",
      "\n",
      "When we run `wc -l *.pdb > lengths`, the computer to creates a new process.\n",
      "Then `wc` reads from the input files (given in the command). We've also used `>`, so instead of sending the output to the default stdout (the screen), it sends it to the file we specify. \n",
      "\n",
      "When we run a pipe, like `wc -l *.pdb | sort`,\n",
      "the shell creates two processes\n",
      "(one for each process in the pipe)\n",
      "so that `wc` and `sort` run simultaneously.\n",
      "The standard output of the first process (`wc`) is fed directly to the standard input of the next (`sort`). This can continue down a series of pipes. With the command `wc -l *.pdb | sort | head -1`,\n",
      "we get three processes with data flowing from the files,\n",
      "through `wc` to `sort`,\n",
      "and from `sort` through `head` to the screen.\n",
