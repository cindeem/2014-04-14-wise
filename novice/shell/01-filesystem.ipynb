      "Today, most computers have two interfaces:   \n",

      "\n",
      "Most people interact with their computers using the GUI. The Shell is just a program, but it allows us to interact with the computer operating system using text (a command line). A Terminal lets us run a shell.\n",
      " \n",

      "  * I this course we will focus in __bash__ as it is most common, but the basic commands discussed are very similar across all the shells.\n",
