> This data comes from:

> I am comparing two sites on the San Pablo Bay and seeing if I can determine from the data whether there is a real difference in self design and engineered tidal wetland restoration.  The two sites are Tubbs Setback and Guadal Canal.  They have been monitored by the USGS in mostly consistent fashion.

> Two veg files attached.  Left off sediment

> group by location, time, spp code and compare the two

> veg or birds
